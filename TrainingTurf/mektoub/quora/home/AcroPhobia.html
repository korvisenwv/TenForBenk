Acrophobia <a> <br>- smething which i have always known...but didnt knw the exact word for it.. it all started with the movie baazigar ..
	
protogonist of the film also had the same fear or phobia...which our hero capitalized on..
how i reached to word is an interesting story .. i heard some song of tiktok of a movie which i had seen but couldnt recall the name..
so i searched with the limited resources i had .. that ritesh deshmukh and shraddha kapoor... that preety much gave the answer but.. 
like mind is alwazs curious ..was crusing through a wikipedia page and realized that there's an hyperlink on a bit famous name aamna sharif,
i clicked and find out that this particular actress has this phobia.. so thank you..
