Subject thinks in binary..
If the question comes of cleaning room..if you have cleaned everything and just forgot to clean 5 % of the room...then you will be judged as not cleaned the room..
Technically subject is correct.. but morally incorect..since we all are people of emotions..and it drives the other person indignant , because you have snatched all credits for cleaning the 90% of the room.

Subjects Realisation-(10/13)

Subjects husband is not a postive person.. He is only positive for himself..In Real for everyone surrounding he is a negative person..because he dosent go to shop wen his mom asks him to go to shop..also he is very selfish.
because he asked for a small piece of fish when subject was eating the newly bought pamplet fish fry...According to subject he  wanted to make sure that he gets atleast something of the fish.. had the subject finish the 
fish before he is back from bath...Subject took offense for this action and boycotted the fish and got ready for the a mini hunger strike only to be eventually broken in the night...wen she felt the unbearable
hunger and give in, prepared dhosas and eat....Subjects Husband believes subject will taken offense even on reading these logs...

Remedy- IF subjects had the patience to have sit down and have a discussion with him... she would get to know that.. it has been a trait of subjects husband to eat the deliciously thing whenever they see..its kind of monkey..
behaviour.. which he has got in his childhood days...and his mother or anyone who is cooking will not taken offense for this cheeky behaviour.. But considering subjects strong belief against this action.. he should have been more
careful..

Causes: One of the major reason behind this rant was Cleaning activity.. which subject has single handedly undertaken... why "single handedly"? is another long chapter which might require few volumes. COming back to 
Cleaning Activity...subject has worked very hard and feels exploited or overburdened(which btw is the word I got on looking into the thesaures)

Consequense: Environment inside the house will become hostile. Constant rant of subject can ride any saint insane. Both the parties will lose an ample amount of productive time brooding over the debate..yaaa..
sure will not write it as "fight" .. Due to the subject this peculiar behaviour , he loses this strength to make his case...and defend the action..
